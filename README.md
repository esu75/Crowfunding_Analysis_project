### Crowfunding_Analysis_Project_using Excel
---------------------------------------------
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this project, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Used conditional formatting to fill each cell in the outcome column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or is currently live.

step 2: Created a new column called Percent Funded that uses a formula to find how much money a campaign made relative to its initial funding goal.
